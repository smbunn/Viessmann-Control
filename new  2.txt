Pros:  The lights all worked, were bright, the electronics worked with multiple sequences like strobing and Mexican waves.

Cons: The electrics are almost definitely illegal in any country apart from China.  The units are mains powered right out to the control box, which is supposed to be IP44 water tight and used outdoors. It is not in the slightest water proof and very flimsy. A very thin power cord, definitely not double insulated or rated at 220 volts takes power to uninsulated soldered terminals in the control box and less than 1/10 of a millimeter from the LED circuits. The slightest fault in soldering would expose the LEDs themselves to the full 220 volts, and with no earth, there is no protection.  Most Christmas lights like this use a 5V DC power-pack inside the house, exposing only the safe 5 Volts to the outside world, so any fault cannot harm the user.
I would only use these where you are sure you understand the risks and there is no possibility of contact with the lights and the control unit is carefully protected from the rain and any water.
